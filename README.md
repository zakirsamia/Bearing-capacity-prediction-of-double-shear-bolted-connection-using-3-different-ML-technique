# Bearing-capacity-prediction-of-double-shear-bolted-connection-using-3-different-ML-technique
Modern steel structures usually are connected by welding or bolting. Bolting has many advantages over welding. Bolting does not require costly high-quality workmanship and enables rapid construction, and therefore is favored in the field. Most of the prediction formula of bearing capacity currenltly available are applicable for a particular material grade or bolt arrangement. No generalized approach of predicting this capacity is available. In this scenario, current study focuses on building a machine learning based prediction model of normalized bearing capacity using three different machine models namely linear regression, random forest and AdaBoost.
